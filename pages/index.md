Hey, I am Adkimsm, a student who likes programming from China, like to learn new skills. I want to be a fanatical open sourceror and a full-stack developer.

Creater of [AdonS](https://github.com/kysolva/AdonS), [Scadies](https://github.com/kysolva/scadies).
Core team member of [Kysolva](https://github.com/kysolva) and [EHStudio](https://github.com/ChinaEHStudio)

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find some of my projects list [here](/projects).

Nowadays I am studying Vue.js, Rust and Linux developing. I am aslo glad to learn some new technology of Web such as Svelte or Remix.

Outside of programming, I am a common student. I am interested in English, Computer Science, Politics and History. I always get better grades than the most of y classmates.
